Description: Are you ready?
Welcome to the WeBWorK.  This installation script will ask you a few questions and then attempt to install 
WeBWorK on your system. To complete the installation
.
  (a) You must be connected to the internet.
  (b) You must have administrative privliges on this machine, and
  (c) The mysql server must be running
.
Also, you should have already gone through the process of setting up the
root mysql account and securing your mysql server.  If you haven't done this 
or aren't sure if it has been done then exit this script and do
'sudo service mysqld start' to start mysql, and then 'mysql_secure_installation' to 
secure the server and set the root password.  Once you know the root mysql 
password then you can come back to this script and install webwork.
